# ðŸ’¡ Smart Goal Planner

This is a single-page interactive React component (`GoalPlanner`) that allows users to manage personal financial goals. Users can add savings goals, make deposits toward them, view progress visually, and delete goals no longer needed. The app connects to a simple backend (`json-server` or Express) for full CRUD functionality.

---

## âœ¨ Features

- Add new financial goals (name, target amount, category, deadline)
- Make deposits toward specific goals
- View progress with animated progress bars
- Delete goals from the list
- Automatically reloads goals on each operation
- Clean and minimal form-based UI
- Fetches data from a RESTful API (`localhost:3001/goals`)

---

## ðŸ§± Technologies Used

- **React** â€“ Functional components + Hooks
- **Fetch API** â€“ For data fetching
- **CSS** â€“ Basic styles in `globals.css`
- **json-server or Express** â€“ For a local REST API

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

### 1. Clone the project

`
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/smart-goal-planner.git
cd smart-goal-planner
`

### 2.Install dependencies
`
npm install
`

### 3.Start the frontend
`
npm run dev
`

### 4. Start the backend (json-server)

#### Install and start json-server if not using Express:
`
npm install -g json-server
`

#### Create a file db.json:
`
{
  "goals": []
}
`

- Start the server:
`
json-server --watch db.json --port 3001
`

    The API will now be available at http://localhost:3001/goals

  "targetAmount": 2000,
  "savedAmount": 500,
  "category": "Travel",
  "deadline": "2025-12-31",
